Smart trash can system. Each tank is equipped with a sensor for the amount of garbage (for example, a range finder) and Internet access (for example, a NodeMCU board). Information about each tank is sent through the server to the database, on the basis of which a route for garbage collection is subsequently built.
To create that system you need:
- NodeMCU board;
- Ultrasonic rangefinder HC-SR04;
- to 5V converter;
- additional modules optional (e.g. servos, buttons, etc.)
